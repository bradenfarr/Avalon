        <h1>When it comes to the overall look of the cabin, the current Avalon represents 
          a big step up relative to models from previous generations. A broad waterfall-style 
          center stack separates the driver and front passenger, and it shows off handsome 
          switchgear and an easy-to-reach touchscreen. The plastics used throughout the cabin 
          are nicely grained, and the back seat provides lots of room for tall passengers to 
          stretch their legs. In addition, there's a cavernous trunk with 16 cubic feet of cargo 
          space. Standard folding rear seats with a 60/40 split allow you to easily expand this 
          capacity when toting large items. In our testing of the non-hybrid version, we fit 
          seven carry-on suitcases in the trunk and 18 with the back seats folded. The hybrid 
          we tested back in 2019 used the old, larger battery pack which intruded into the 
          trunk and limited cargo space. That car fit fewer suitcases (six with the rear seats 
          in use and 17 with them folded), but Toyota says the new lithium-ion battery is 
          smaller and preserves all of the Avalon's trunk space.</h1>
