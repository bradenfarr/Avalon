            The Toyota Avalon gives buyers a choice of two powertrains: one that sips gas exclusively and another that uses a fuel-efficient hybrid setup. 
            A 3.5-liter V-6 that delivers 301 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque is standard. An eight-speed automatic transmission sends power to the front wheels; 
            XLE and Limited models offer optional all-wheel drive, but those models come with a 202-hp 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine. 
            The V-6 hustles the Avalon from to 60 mph in 6.0 seconds, according to our testing. Going with the 2.5-liter four and 
            all-wheel drive drops the zero-to-60-mph time to a sluggish 7.7 seconds and the four-cylinder's coarse nature doesn't match the car's otherwise luxurious nature. 
            Trim levels with hybrid in their nomenclature come with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder and two electric motors. 
            This setup provides a net output of 215 horsepower, and it's paired with a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) that powers the front wheels.
            Many shoppers who seek out large cars like the Avalon prioritize comfort, and Toyota's big sedan doesn't disappoint in this area. In our tests, 
            it delivered well-mannered handling that did an admirable job of keeping bumps and jolts out of the cabin.

            the 2021 Avalon sports a nine-inch Audio Plus touchscreen display that comes with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, 
            Bluetooth Connectivity, Amazon Alexa Compatibility, an Eight-speaker sound system, and four USB charge ports, 
            to name a few. You can also opt for the premium system that upgrades it with 14 JBL speakers and Dynamic Navigation.

            On all trips (long and short) the Avalon is comfortable and quiet. The seats are heated and cooled. The backseat gets raving good revues from our backseat passengers.
